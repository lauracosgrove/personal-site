<h1>Laura Cosgrove</h1>

<p class="top">Hi! I’m Laura. I’m a researcher, graduate student, and health tech startup employee living in NYC.</p>
<p>Some recent descriptors of me I’ve overheard:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>budding biostatistician</p></li>
  <li><p>research maven</p></li>
  <li><p> "has two sentences to say about just about anything"</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I remember and include the above a drib for their good fit, a drab for their complimentary content, and a bit for the pleasing way they’re put.</p>
<p>My raison d’etre/career goal, as far as I can pin it, is the joy of learning something new.</p>
