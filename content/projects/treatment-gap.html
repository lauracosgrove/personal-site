<h1>Treatment Gap</h1>

<p class="top">One of my first projects at MedicaSafe while I was still finishing up my last year in undergrad was to visualize the treatment gap for patients with opioid use disorder.</p>
<h2> Motivation </h2>
<p>The treatment gap refers to the lack of capacity to use buprenorphine to treat those with dire need of evidence-based pharmacological treatment for opioid use disorder in many areas in the U.S. This gap may occur partly due to the restriction on prescribing buprenorphine for medication-assisted treatment of opioid addiction to certified providers, as well as a constellation of other factors including individual physiciansâ€™ resistance and, perhaps, organizational disincentives. This problem can be particularly intense in rural or suburban areas, where rates of opioid overdose-related deaths are typically higher.
</p>
<h2> My Role </h2>
<p>This was an independent project. I prepared data by querying the CDC Wonder database using guidelines from UCSD prof. Peter Davidson <a href="https://overdosedeaths.org/index.php">(site)</a>. I cleaned data in Excel and visualized with Tableau Public.</p>
